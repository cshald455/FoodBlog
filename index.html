        <p>My yelp reviews have been featured on national television and Gordon Ramsay says they are really good.<br>
          <p>I also invented the taco</p>

            <img src = "MonkeyEatingTaco.jpg" height = "200px" width = "200px">
            <p> As you all know I invented the taco.<br>
              <p> What you might not know though is that I also patented tacos.<br>
                <p> So basically, I can sue taco bell.<br>
                  <p> I will sue taco bell, im going to destroy the taco bell.</p>

    <p>My favorite foods are different types of tacos.</p>
    <p>Number 1: Hard Shell Taco, it's hard. You put meat, cheese, and lettuce in it and it's yummy. Also I invented it.</p>
    <p>Number 2: Soft Shell Taco, it's soft while maintaining the taste of a hardshell taco, the only difference is texture.</p>
    <p>Number 3:Ramen Taco, The shell is ramen. Thats wild yo. It has the taste of ramen and a taco and those two compliment each other</p>
    <p>Number 4: Taco Taco, its taco inside of another taco. It is another one of my inventions. I thought of it when i was like "hmm you know whats better than a taco? two tacos" and then i put a taco inside of another taco</p>
